# Hello, I'm Richard

I make puzzles like the one below. Can you find a path from left to right?

# HOW TO ANSWER

1. A valid answer takes the form of 20 hex digits. Ex. 331B6A6E547A1E4536BD
2. Create an issue with the title `Puzzle|ANSWER`
3. Replace `ANSWER` with your answer. Ex. `Puzzle|E3A2...`

**NOTE**: I'm currently debugging this repo, so the above puzzle may have no solution!
