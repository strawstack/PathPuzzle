# Hello, I'm Richard

I make puzzles like the one below. Can you find a path from left to right?

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|4|8|3|9|3|3|E|C|A|2|C|1|
|E|E|5|B|1|8|1|2|C|7|C|3|6|
|5|7|4|1|1|E|1|1|2|1|8|D|C|
|4|6|4|1|2|E|C|A|2|1|C|4|4|
|**C**|2|9|9|2|2|3|3|1|1|1|5|**4**|
|8|2|1|6|7|8|8|1|A|8|8|5|8|

Result: Incorrect

## Hint

A valid answer takes the form of 23 hex digits. 

Example: `B337EAA1B1BB2A39B9626E8`

Having trouble? Take a look at the `bit patterns` for the numbers above.

Example: `3` -> `0011` and `C` -> `1100`
