# Hello, I'm Richard

I make puzzles like the one below. 

Can you find the path from left to right?

## Hint

A valid answer takes the form of 19 hex digits. 

Example: `3C779A979DA516C23DC`

Check out the bold, underlined, numbers in the left and right-most columns. Can you find a path between them?

Having trouble? Take a look at the `bit patterns` for the numbers above.

Example: `3` -> `0011` and `C` -> `1100`
